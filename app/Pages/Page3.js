      <h1> Turn Out Lights Visible From the Beach </h1>
       <p>
        Sea turtle hatchlings use light and reflections from the moon to find their way to the water at
        night. Artificial lighting confuses the hatchlings and causes them to head inland instead of
        out to sea – putting them in dangerous situations which can lead to death. Artificial lights also
        discourage adult females from nesting on the beach. Short of turning off your lights, you can
        also take measures to shield, redirect and lower the intensity of the lights on your property.
      </p>
      <h1> Reduce the Amount of Garbage You Produce and Clean Up Trash
You See On the Beach. </h1>
      <p>
      Sea turtles can become tangled in plastic and trash both on the shore and in the water.
      Discarded items such as fishing lines, balloons and plastic bags may also be confused for
      food and eaten by sea turtles, often resulting in injury or death
      </p>
      <h1> Be Aware of Sea Turtle Nesting Areas and Avoid Nesting and
Hatching Turtles </h1>
      <p>
      Sea turtles are cute, and therefore tempting to touch and observe – but flashlights and
      people disturb turtles when they are nesting, or trying to nest, on the beach. Make sure
      to give nesting areas plenty of space, and do not disturb females as they emerge from the
      ocean looking for a place to nest. Also be conscious of where nesting areas are so that you
      can avoid trampling the hatchlings as they head to the water.
      </p>
      <h1> Volunteer! </h1>
      <p>
        There are countless ways in which you can make a positive difference in the lives of sea
        turtles. Organize a clean-up day with your friends and clear the beach of litter, give a
        presentation to your neighborhood or local school on things they can do to save sea
        turtles, and most importantly, talk to others about what they can do to make sure they
        are not putting these important creatures in danger.
